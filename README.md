# Project-10---Used-Cars-Price-Prediction

Objective: The objective of this project is to analyze a dataset containing info about used vehicles in the US, including their prices, brands, models, years, mileage, condition and other relevant factors. The goal is to gain insights and provide meaningful info to assist in decision-making processes related to buying or selling used cars. 

Hypothesis Statement: Based on the given dataset, the hypothesis of this project could be the following: “The prices of a used vehicle is influenced by factors such as its brand, model, year, mileage, condition and location.”
To test this hypothesis, we can explore the relationships between the price and the various features of the vehicles. Additionally, we can investigate whether there are any significant differences in prices based on factors such as brand, model or condition. This analysis will provide valuable insights into the factors that contribute to the pricing of used vehicles and help in best understanding the market trends.
